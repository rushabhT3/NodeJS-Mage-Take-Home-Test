# NodeJS-Mage-Take-Home-Test

Instructions to run the code on a local machine:

   a. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rushabhT3/NodeJS-Mage-Take-Home-Test.git
   cd NodeJS-Mage-Take-Home-Test
   ```

   b. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

   c. To run the server:
   ```bash
   node main.js
   ```

   d. In a separate terminal, to run the client:
   ```bash
   node client3.js
   ```

   e. The client will connect to the server, request data, and generate a 'stock_data.json' file in the same directory.

Note: The original server file is named 'main.js', and the new client file is 'client3.js'.
